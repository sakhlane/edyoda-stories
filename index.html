                    <p class="content-color">An income-share agreement (ISA) is a form of college financing wherein
                        repayments are based on a studentâ€™s future income. An ISA provider gives the student money to
                        pay for college, and the student contractually agrees to pay the provider a percentage of their
                        salary for a set period of time.

                    <p class="content-color">Both stacks run on Linux OS. MERN uses the latest versions of the
                        technology in its frameworks, whereas LAMP can run on PHP platforms without any issues. MERN is
                        far better than LAMP since the former uses NodeJS, making it easier to run on JavaScript
                        platforms without significant problems
